## Coding

1. Started by looking at the HTML and the code given
2. I got lost with the directions in the JS file so I deleted the contents to start fresh
3. I looked up how to link functions and buttons to HTML
4. I decided it would be easier to design HTML items for Users to click on that is a little bit more real world compared to the project designed in this week's module
5. I looked up how to recognize form inputs and how to link them. 
6. I looked at the robot-gladitors for some inspiration. I thought about creating a password "object" that the function would store values and then print it; however, I figured this would be too complicated to code and to keep it very randomized.
7. Sought TA help to figure out for loops and to contain undefined values that kept popping up. My array would infinite loops if user didn't select anything and hit "generate code"
    * We were able to close that by adding a default if statement that would fill it with lowercase letters if nothing selected
    * Created an alert to let user know lowercase is selected
    * Was able to find the part of my array amount that was created undefined numbers as it was selected all numbers instead of just the confined list of values
